Those of you who do not regularly read the forum may be unaware that Tracks 2.0 Release Candidate 2 has now been prepared by Reinier Balt. You can read all the [details](http://www.getontracks.org/forums/viewthread/839/) on the forum, or just head straight over to Github to download the 2.0RC2 branch [here](https://github.com/bsag/tracks/zipball/v2.0RC2).

We need your help in testing it out, so please give it a try and let us know of any bugs or problems on [this forum thread](http://www.getontracks.org/forums/viewthread/839/). Many thanks!
