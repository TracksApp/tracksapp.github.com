I've been hard at work for the past couple of weeks and have re-designed this site -- as you can hopefully see! I used to use [Textpattern](http://www.textpattern.com/) for the site, which was very good, but I found it a bit tricky to maintain and extend. So after playing with a few CMSs, I decided to use the free [ExpressionEngine Core](http://www.pmachine.com/ee/). It's really flexible, which has meant that I can easily maintain a more or less static front page with the features of Tracks, and then have dynamic pages for news, articles and so on.

I've added the existing installation instructions to start off a manual, which I'll be adding to over the coming months. Commenting now uses CAPTCHAs, which I agonised a bit about because of the lack of accessibility, but moderating all comments was becoming a real pain. If anyone has problems submitting a comment, please drop me a line and I'll try to sort it out. Note that the URL for the feed has changed (the link is in the sidebar). If anyone knows how to redirect RSS feeds, please let me know!

Until I've sorted out redirection, internal links might be broken. If you want to manually fix them to get to the article you want, just substitute the two digits in the URL with 'comments' and 'article' with 'articles'. I'm working on this.
