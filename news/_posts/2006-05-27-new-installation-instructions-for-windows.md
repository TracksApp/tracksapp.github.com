<p>Jim Strupp has written a very detailed and helpful installation guide for installing Tracks on Windows, using Uniform Server. He&#8217;s also added instructions for putting Uniform Server and Tracks on a USB memory stick, so that you can take Tracks with you and use it on any computer with Ruby installed. You can download a PDF of his instructions <a href="http://bsag.bingodisk.com/public/files/tracks_on_windows_installation.pdf">here</a>. Thanks, Jim!</p>
