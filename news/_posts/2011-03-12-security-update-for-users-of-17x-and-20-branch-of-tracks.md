An important message from Reinier Balt:

I was informed by private email that a XSS vulnerability is present in 1.7.2. It turned out to also exist in the upcoming 2.0. 

A new release of 1.7.3 is made available [here](https://github.com/bsag/tracks/zipball/v1.7.3). Users of 1.7x are strongly advised to upgrade to 1.7.3. If you are running 2.0RC2 or 2.0devel for production, please upgrade to the latest 2.0 tree found [here](https://github.com/bsag/tracks/zipball/master)  

I have also updated the manual with upgrade instructions.
