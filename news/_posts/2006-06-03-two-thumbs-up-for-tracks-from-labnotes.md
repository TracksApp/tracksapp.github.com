Assaf has said some very nice things about Tracks over at "Labnotes":http://blog.labnotes.org/2006/05/26/getting-things-done-with-tracks/:

<blockquote>
<p>
If you're looking for an Outlook-like experience, you'll be disappointed. Tracks is not "___ for the Web", it's about organizing your next actions the GTD way. Yet, it doesn't impose any strict set of rules, it guides you gently towards a better way to organize stuff.
