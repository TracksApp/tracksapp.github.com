I'm in the process of sorting out a new version of the GTD application that uses Rails 0.9.1. The porting went surprisingly well, but I'm also taking the opportunity to fix a few niggling things before I do so.

It should be on the way soon--I'll post here when it's done, and post a link for it on the [downloads](http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/downloads/) page.
