Bitnami has updated their Tracks installer to version 2.1 of Tracks. If you'd like to install Tracks on a local machine, but do not like to do all the configuration yourself, this could be a good solution for you. try [BitNami](http://bitnami.org/stack/tracks) -- it runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. But they also support preconfigured virtual machines, including Amazon machine images.
