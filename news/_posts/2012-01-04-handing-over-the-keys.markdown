If you have been following posts on the mailing list and on this site, you'll know that I've been in the process of handing the Tracks project on for others in the community to take over. That day has come much closer now because I have finally finished the process of adapting the old site to be published on GitHub (using the excellent [Octopress][1]). It has taken a bit of time to get right, and there may be a few glitches here and there while the DNS propagates, but things should be working. Most of the site is how it was, except that the forum is now read only, as an archive of useful information. Some of the links in the forum may be broken (for example the search facility and member profiles) in the process of generating a static version, but the basic information should still be available.

In due course I'll transfer the domain name to someone else in the Tracks community, transfer the balance of the Pledgie donations, and I'll have handed all the keys over.

I'd like to take this opportunity for thanking all the Tracks users for their support over the years. Tracks is in great hands, and I'm sure it will continue from strength to strength in the future.
