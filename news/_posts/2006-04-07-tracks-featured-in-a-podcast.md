Mike Lamb kindly let me know that Tracks was featured in the [Cubicle Escape Podcast](http://www.cubicleescape.com/v3/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=242&Itemid=37). They seemed to like Tracks, but have trouble with the installation, which I know many people do. I try to make installation as easy as possible, but Rails-based applications do unfortunately need quite a few dependencies to be installed first. As a side note, if you're not an alpha level geek, it's worth trying one of the one-click Rails environments. There's [Locomotive](http://locomotive.raaum.org/home/show/HomePage) for Mac OS X and [Instant Rails](http://instantrails.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl) for Windows.
