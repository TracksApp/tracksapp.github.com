You might have noticed the new box at the top of the sidebar on the right. Joyent &mdash; the company that produces the Joyent Connector online team management software, TextDrive webhosting, Strongspace secure backup space and Bingo! online storage &mdash; is participating in an affiliate programme. It works like this: if you click the links to the right and subsequently sign up for any of the services, I will get 15% of the sale, which will go towards supporting Tracks development.

I'm usually very wary of advertising of any form, but in this case, I'm happy to do it. After all, I eat my own dog food! All of my sites are hosted by TextDrive, and I've been more than happy with the service. I also have a Strongspace account, which is incredibly useful.

So if you're looking for hosting, online storage or backup or team management software, do give them a look, and perhaps we can all benefit!
