Hi all,

Tracks 2.2 is being released today with two bugfixes! One bug prevented Tracks to be used on ruby 1.8.7, this release fixes that.

You can download the release [here](https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/archive/v2.2.1.zip). Upgrade instructions can be found [in the manual](https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/blob/v{{site.version}}/doc/upgrading.textile)
