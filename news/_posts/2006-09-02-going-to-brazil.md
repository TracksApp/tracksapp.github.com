Like [last year](http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/news/comments/away-for-most-of-september/), I'm going to Brazil to work for most of September, and I leave tomorrow. I won't have any email or web access while I'm there, so I obviously won't be responding to support requests. Until I get back, you could try posting any requests for help on the forum or the mailing list.

Have fun, and see you when I get back!
