I'm off to Brazil for a work course again on Monday, and I'll be away for 3 weeks. I won't have email or web access during that time, so can I ask that you direct any questions to the forum or mailing list where other Tracks users will be able to help you. If you want to make a pull request on GitHub, or if you've got a patch, [lukemelia](https://github.com/lukemelia), [lrbalt](https://github.com/lrbalt) and [epall](https://github.com/epall) all have commit rights to the main repository, so you can send your request to them.

Have a great summer everyone, and I'll post again when I get back!
