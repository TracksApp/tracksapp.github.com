<del>Apologies for the errors on the [development site](http://dev.rousette.org.uk/). There's a technical problem with Trac (which runs the ticket and wiki system) at the moment, and it's in the process of being fixed.</del> It's fixed now.

While I'm here, I'd like to say that &mdash; contrary to the apparent lack of activity on this site &mdash; Tracks is alive and kicking, and I and the other contributors have been hard at work improving and adding new features to Tracks. It's been quite a long time since the last stable update, in part because I wanted Rails to stabilise feature-wise before I put out another release. Rails reached 1.0 a little while ago, and has some great new features that make my life a lot easier, so I'm hoping that there will be a new release of Tracks out very soon.

I'm reluctant to put a fixed time on it because I can only work on it in my so-called spare time, so progress is inversely determined by how busy my life and work is. However, I can say that I'm just going to try to add one more feature, make life as easy as possible for those installing and those upgrading from the existing version, and then I'll just be squashing bugs before Tracks 1.04 is out.
