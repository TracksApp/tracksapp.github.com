I'm off on a work trip to Brazil shortly, and will return in the last week of September. I'm almost certainly not going to be able to get a network connection, so things are likely to be a bit quiet around here for a couple of weeks.

Do continue to post ideas and bug fixes to [Trac](http://dev.rousette.org.uk/), and I'll sort through them when I get back. Nic has agreed (even though he's really busy at the moment too) to check through them intermittently and try to deal with anything urgent.

However, Tracks development won't stop: I'm taking a Linux-based laptop on which I can hack away during those long tropical nights, and I'm hoping to squash a few bug and perhaps add a new feature or two while I'm away. That's the plan, anyway.

See you when I return!
