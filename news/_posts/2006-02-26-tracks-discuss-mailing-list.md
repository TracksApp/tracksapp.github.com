**Update 28/02/2006:** The mailing list is working fine again now, so subscribe away!

**Update 27/02/2006: There seems to be a problem with the mailing list, so please hold off signing up while I try to track down the problem. I'll update this post again when it's sorted out.**

I've set up a mailing list for people wanting to discuss Tracks, suggest features, offer tips or help others with installation. You can subscribe either by visiting the [information page](http://lists.rousette.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/tracks-discuss) and following the instructions, or by sending an email with a blank subject and body to tracks - discuss - join [at] lists dot rousette dot org dot uk. Emails sent to tracks - discuss [at] lists dot rousette dot org dot uk will get distributed to the list.

I can't promise that I will be able to respond personally to all of the postings to the list, but I'm hoping that a user community will grow up around it that can help out new users.
