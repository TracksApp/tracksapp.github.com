I'm not sure how many Tracks users also read my blog, so I thought I'd explain my unscheduled period of inactivity here too. I had to [go into hospital](http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/archives/2006/10/16/the-lost-week/) for an operation, and am now on sick leave from work for 6 weeks. At the moment, I'm still feeling very sore and tired, so it might be a while before I catch up on emails, forum postings and tickets. As ever, thanks to all those who held the fort in my absence (and sorry I couldn't let you know in advance -- it was all a bit sudden), particularly Luke, who has carried on producing some great fixes while I've been away.
