As you may know, we are in the process of moving the project and all the related web resources over to GitHub. As a first step, I have set up the [Tracks project](https://github.com/TracksApp) as a GitHub Organisation, which makes it easier for people to administer and collaborate on the project. I have also moved the content of the entire wiki over to a GitHub wiki, [here](https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/wiki). I've removed the old wiki to avoid confusion, and redirected the URL to the new wiki.

You can still contribute to the new wiki: if you have a GitHub account, you can edit and add pages. I hope you like the new wiki - I think it is a big improvement, and a lot more flexible.
