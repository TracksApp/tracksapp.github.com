Manuel Morales from [BitNami](http://bitnami.org/) emailed to tell me about the [Tracks Stack](http://bitnami.org/stack/tracks) they have developed. These are easy to install, multi-platform packages for installing various Open Source applications. You download a package which installs as a stand-alone stack of all of the components required to run the application. What this means is that if you want to run Tracks on Windows XP, Linux or Mac OS X, but you don't really know where to start with installing Ruby, Rails and MySQL, you can just download the stack. It installs everything you need and even configures the application and the database for you. The Tracks Stack installs the brand spanking new Tracks version 1.5rc1.

So if you're interested by Tracks but have been daunted by the installation procedure, give a [Tracks Stack](http://bitnami.org/stack/tracks) a whirl!
