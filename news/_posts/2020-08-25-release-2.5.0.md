Tracks 2.5.0 has finally been released! This new version brings
a new default color scheme, dependency upgrades and smaller changes
to the UI along with some bug fixes.

Tracks is now running on Rails 6.0. Ruby versions below 2.5 are no
longer supported. This release of Tracks is fully tested on Ruby
2.6.

Other changes:
* .skip-docker file has been replaced with .use-docker, see upgrading.md for
  details.
* Added email, last login, creation and update time to the user model.
* Added terms of service and email fields to the signup form. The TOS link is
  defined in site.yml, see config/site.yml.tmpl.
* New, lighter default color scheme. The black color scheme is also available
  for selection in the user preferences. Default theme can be set in site.yml.
* Added a help page to the ? menu linking to online help assets.
* Allow the user to remove their own account.
