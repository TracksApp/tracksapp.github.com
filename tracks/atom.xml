<p>It is finally done! You can now [download]<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Tracks version 2.1 from github.<br />
We did our best to test this new version well, but any problems you may have<br />

too.</p>
<p>Do not forget to migrate your database if you are coming from 2.0 or from<br />
2.1RC1. And since we have migrated to bundler for managing dependencies, run<br />
<code>bundle install</code> (instead of <code>rake gems:install</code>). If you use passenger and<br />
the gems will not load using bundler, set the <code>BUNDLER_PATH</code> in<br />
<code>.bundler/config</code>. See the installation and upgrade manual for more details.</p>
<p>We have seen a lot of new contributions from several contributers: Ignacio<br />
Ihuerta, Christof Spies, Stefan Richter, Mickey Reiss, Demian Gemperli, Matt<br />
Rogers, Jan Stępień, Antonin Blanc, Christian Frank, Sebastian Fischmeister,<br />
Andreas Brandl, Craig Maloney, Pavel Zupa, Tim Madden, Jaime Hernandez,<br />

<p>Thanks to all of you!!</p>
<p>The current release is based on rails 2.3 and only supports ruby 1.8.7. This<br />
infrastructure is getting outdated. For release 2.2 we will upgrade this to<br />
rails 3 and support ruby 1.8.7 and ruby 1.9.3.</p>
<p>This release brings a lot of new goodies:</p>
<p>New and changed features:</p>
<p>1. Redesign of the completed todos: a new overview page. Also all context<br />
and  project pages have a link to their completed actions<br />
2. New locales (es by Ignacio Ihuerta, fr by Antonin Blanc, cz by Pavel Zupa<br />
and he by Damian Shalev) and updated locales (de, nl)<br />
3. You can star an action right from the form for adding a new action<br />
4. Redesign of preferences page<br />
5. You can now mark an action complete from the tickler<br />
6. Project names can now contain comma (&#8216;,&#8217;) in it name<br />
7. Context view now shows hidden and pending actions<br />
8. Mobile improvements (we now require some javascript support on the<br />
mobile)<br />
9. Two extra defer periods in the context menu of an action<br />
10.There is a review page where you can see stalled or neglected projects.<br />
There is a reviewed button on the project edit page to mark a project<br />
reviewed.<br />
11.You need to change your password: migrated to better BCrypt hash algoritm<br />
for storing passwords</p>
<p>New features (technical)</p>
<p>1. There are two example ruby scripts in /doc to use the <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span> to add a<br />
todo or a project template with todos from the command line<br />
2. The tag page can now select actions from mulitple tags using <span class="caps">AND</span> and OR.<br />
There is no gui for this. Syntax is /todos/tag/tagA,tagB?and=tagC to select<br />
all todos with (tagA or tagB) <span class="caps">AND</span> tagC</p>
<p>Under the hood:</p>
<p>1. Upgraded rails to 2.3.12, jquery to 1.7.1 and jquery-ui to 1.8.17<br />

<p>It is finally release candidate time! You can now <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/zipball/v2.1RC1">download</a> Tracks version 2.1 RC1 from github. Please try it out to see if you think it is ready for public release. Any problems you have can be posted to <a href="www.assembla.com/spaces/tracks-tickets/">Assembla</a>. Improvements for translations are welcome too.</p>

<p>I will update the installation and upgrade manual soon. I am talking to BSAG to find out how to do this on getontracks.org after the migration of the site to github. In general, you can follow the upgrade manual. Do not forget to migrate your database if you are coming from 2.0. And since we have migrated to bundler for managing dependencies, run &#8220;bundle install&#8221; (instead of rake gems:install). If you use passenger and the gems will not load using bundler, set the BUNDLER_PATH in .bundler/config.</p>

    <id>http://TracksApp.github.com/news/comments/handing-over-the-keys</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have been following posts on the mailing list and on this site, you&#8217;ll know that I&#8217;ve been in the process of handing the Tracks project on for others in the community to take over. That day has come much closer now because I have finally finished the process of adapting the old site to be published on GitHub (using the excellent <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>). It has taken a bit of time to get right, and there may be a few glitches here and there while the DNS propagates, but things should be working. Most of the site is how it was, except that the forum is now read only, as an archive of useful information. Some of the links in the forum may be broken (for example the search facility and member profiles) in the process of generating a static version, but the basic information should still be available.</p>

<p>In due course I&#8217;ll transfer the domain name to someone else in the Tracks community, transfer the balance of the Pledgie donations, and I&#8217;ll have handed all the keys over.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to take this opportunity for thanking all the Tracks users for their support over the years. Tracks is in great hands, and I&#8217;m sure it will continue from strength to strength in the future.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As you may know, we are in the process of moving the project and all the related web resources over to GitHub. As a first step, I have set up the <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp">Tracks project</a> as a GitHub Organisation, which makes it easier for people to administer and collaborate on the project. I have also moved the content of the entire wiki over to a GitHub wiki, <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/wiki">here</a>. I&#8217;ve removed the old wiki to avoid confusion, and redirected the <span class="caps">URL</span> to the new wiki.</p>
<p>You can still contribute to the new wiki: if you have a GitHub account, you can edit and add pages. I hope you like the new wiki &#8211; I think it is a big improvement, and a lot more flexible.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/zipball/v2.0">Git <span class="caps">URL</span></a></p>
<p>A message from Reinier Balt, who has worked incredibly hard on this release. Congratulations to him and to all the other contributors!</p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>After way too long time (1.7 was released on 28 feb 2009!) we are finally releasing Tracks 2.0. I&#8217;m hoping to shorten the release cycle in the future&#8230;</p>
<p>You can download this new stable version of Tracks <a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/zipball/v2.0">here</a>.</p>
<p>Important for upgrade is that the requirements for running Tracks have changed (ruby 1.8.7 / rubgems ~1.5.0). Also be aware when upgrading from a recent development version or RC version to delete the caches stylesheets and javascripts from your install. The updated installation manual can be found on github and on the Tracks website, also containing the details of the changed requirements and deleting the cached files from your previous install.</p>
<p>Please note that xuinkrbin has started a <a href="http://www.getontracks.org/wiki/Users-Manual">user manual</a> on the wiki. Anyone like to help out and write some stuff about setting up and using Tracks? A user manual if often asked for.</p>
<p>A lot of effort went into Tracks 2.0 and we have seen quite a few new (and old :-) ) contributors helping out with patches and github pull requests. Thanks to you all!</p>
<p>Now, onto the details of this release.</p>
<p>New features:</p>
<p>1. Redesign of menus and introduction of a context menu per todo<br />
2. You can now set the default tags for a project which are added automatically to a new action in that project if no tags are supplied<br />
3. Tracks now includes support of dependencies. Making an action dependent on another action will hide it until the dependency is completed<br />
4. you can now drag an action from one context to another<br />
5. Support for entering multiple actions in one form<br />
6. You can now promote an action to a project<br />
7. It is easier to view notes on the mobile interface and other interface fixes<br />
8. The project description supports markup<br />
9. support for Mail.app (message://) and OneNote (onenote://) links in notes<br />
10.The email receiver is now able to receive email from several email adresses.  In site.yml this could be set to the previous behavior (receive from one address per user)<br />
11.You can enable open signup (like in tracks.tra.in) <br />
12.Cleanup of context page<br />
13.Support for <span class="caps">CAS</span> for login<br />
14.Support for adding Tracks as a GMail Widget with instructions on the Integrations page<br />
15.Tracks now support internationalization. First translations are German and Dutch. See http://www.getontracks.org/wiki/Translating-Tracks it you like to help translating Tracks to other languages. Please report any errors in translations to our bug tracker at Assembla!</p>
<p>Under the hood</p>
<p>1. All js is migrated to jQuery and most ui-widgets are migrated to jQuery-UI<br />
2. Cucumber is added for integration testing. The RSpec stories are migrated to cucumber, so are most selenium scripts<br />
3. Upgraded to rails 2.3.11 and upgraded most gems/plugins<br />
3. Bugfixes (lots of them)</p>]]></content>

<ul>
<li>You can now add a new todo from the calendar view</li>
<li>User names can now contain dots (.)</li>

</ul>
<p>Under the hood:</p>
<ul>
<li>Several fixes for timezone support</li>
<li>Export to xml works again</li>

</ul>
<p>And lots of other fixes&#8230;</p>

The Joyent affiliate programme appears to have ended, and when an opportunity came up to join the <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=188858&amp;b=179734&amp;m=22742&amp;afftrack=&amp;urllink=www%2Ejumpbox%2Ecom">JumpBox</a> affiliate program, I jumped (no pun intended) at the chance.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The nice people at <a href="http://www.jumpbox.com/">JumpBox</a> have just released a <a href="http://jumpbox.com/app/tracks">JumpBox for Tracks 1.7</a>. JumpBoxes are pre-built, pre-configured virtual applications which run in a range of <a href="http://www.jumpbox.com/supported-virtualization-software">Virtualization software applications</a>. You just download the JumpBox (free), then open the file with your Virtualization software. Once the JumpBox has booted, it will give you a <span class="caps">URL</span> which you can visit in a browser. The software will then guide you through setting up an account. If you&#8217;d like to try out the JumpBox without installing it, you can use the &#8220;Trial This JumpBox&#8221; button on the web site, which will let you play around with it to test it out. It&#8217;s great to have another method of using Tracks for those of you who don&#8217;t want to go to the trouble of installing Tracks and its dependencies on your computer, or installing Tracks on a web host. Try it out! You can download it directly <a href="http://download.jumpbox.com/download/tracks">here</a>. I&#8217;ll add links and instructions to the manual in due course.</p>

    <id>http://TracksApp.github.com/downloads/comments/tracks-1.7</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Version: 1.7</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/tree/1.7_branch">Git <span class="caps">URL</span></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m pleased to announce that Tracks 1.7 has been released.</p>
<p>You can download this new stable version of Tracks at <a href="http://bsag.bingodisk.com/public/files/tracks-current.zip">here</a> and an updated manual can be found on <a href="http://github.com/bsag/tracks_manual/tree/master">github</a> and on the <a href="http://getontracks.org/doc/index.html">Tracks website</a></p>
<p>What is new in 1.7:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The included Rails version is updated to 2.2.2</li>
	<li>Tracks now supports recurring/repeating todos</li>
	<li>Cleanup of feed page and add feed for starred actions</li>
	<li>New interface to import an email / sms messages into Tracks (needs an email server on the same server as Tracks)</li>
	<li>New buttons to quickly defer an action 1 or 7 days</li>
	<li>Calendar view to review upcoming due actions, includes iCal feed to use in your calendar app (tested with Google Calendar, Evolution, Outlook 2007)</li>
	<li>You can now sort projects on number of active todos</li>
	<li>Support for OpenSearch. This means you can add a Tracks as a search provider in your webbrowser (tested on FF3 and IE7)</li>
	<li>We now allow users again to stay logged in on two devices at the same time</li>
	<li>Move site specific configuration out of environment.rb into site.yml for easier updating</li>
	<li>Bugfixes, including fixing OpenID</li>
</ul>
<p>(for those using 1.7RC1/1.7RC2 we dropped the initial importer of yaml files because of its experimental state)</p>
<p>There are changes to the database in Tracks 1.7, and changes to the way you configure Tracks, so please migrate your database and redo your Tracks configuration.</p>
<p>In Tracks 1.7 the site specific configuration is moved from environment.rb into the new site.yml. This makes updating environment.rb much easier without you needing to set your site specific settings after each update. After you install/upgrade to Tracks 1.7 there will be no environment.rb.tmpl anymore. You will find an environment.rb which you can leave untouched. Just fill in your settings from your old environment.rb in the new site.yml. If you have made any other customizations to environment.rb in the past, you can put them in your own configuration file (for example, in my-config.rb) in config/initializers. Please let us know if you think they should be in site.yml.tmpl.</p>
<p><span class="caps">WARNING</span>: if you update to 1.7 using git, your environment.rb will be overwritten. SO <span class="caps">PLEASE</span> <span class="caps">MAKE</span> <span class="caps">BACKUPS</span></p>
<p>This release of 1.7 will include enhancements made by a lot new contributers (Jakub, Hans, Piotr, MHarris, Piglop, Farzy, Vitaliel, McVeat and Simon; I hope I didn&#8217;t forget anyone&#8230;). Thank you all for helping Tracks getting better every release. As ever particular thanks to Luke (for updating Tracks to 2.2.2) and to Eric Allen for lots of work on a many fronts, including the site.yml improvements!</p>
<p>Very many thanks to Reinier for his hard work yet again in getting this release together!</p>]]></content>

<p><a href="https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/tree/1.7_branch">Git <span class="caps">URL</span></a></p>
<p>Reinier Balt has already announced the release of Tracks 1.7RC2, but I&#8217;ve finally (and belatedly!) found time to upload the zipped file and update the manual.</p>
<p>Reinier&#8217;s release notes:</p>
<p>We have many improvements based on the feedback on RC1. We felt we should first do a RC2 to make sure all improvements did not introduce new regressions. Please help out to test this second pre-release to find any bugs before we release 1.7 in a few weeks</p>
<p>What was new in RC1:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The included Rails version is updated to 2.2.2</li>
	<li>Tracks now supports recurring/repeating todos</li>
	<li>Cleanup of feed page and add feed for starred actions</li>
	<li>Initial importer of yaml files (still very <span class="caps">EXPERIMENTAL</span>; please send feedback on whether to include this; make backups while testing it)</li>
	<li>New interface to import an email / sms messages into Tracks (needs an email server on the same server as Tracks)</li>
	<li>New buttons to quickly defer an action 1 or 7 days</li>
	<li>Calendar view to review upcoming due actions, includes iCal feed to use in your calendar app (tested with Google Calendar, Evolution, Outlook 2007)</li>
	<li>You can now sort projects on number of active todos</li>
	<li>Support for OpenSearch. This means you can add a Tracks as a search provider in your webbrowser (tested on FF3 and IE7)</li>
	<li>Bugfixes, including fixing OpenID</li>
</ul>
<p>New in RC2:</p>
<ul>
	<li>We now allow users again to stay logged in on two devices at the same time</li>
	<li>Move site specific configuration out of environment.rb into site.yml for easier updating</li>
	<li>Bugfixes, including the upgrade of has_many_polymorphs which will fix the problem of not being able to migrate from 1.6 because of non-existing recurring_todos table.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are changes to the database (even between RC1 and RC2), and changes to the way you configure Tracks, so please migrate your database and redo your Tracks configuration.</p>
<p>In Tracks 1.7RC2 the site specific configuration is moved from environment.rb into the new site.yml. This makes updating environment.rb much easier without you needing to set your site specific settings after each update. After you install/upgrade Tracks 1.7RC2 there will be no environment.rb.tmpl anymore. You will find an environment.rb which you can leave untouched. Just fill in your settings from your old environment.rb in the new site.yml. If you have made any other customizations to environment.rb in the past, you can put them in your own configuration file (for example, in my-config.rb) in config/initializers. Please let us know it you think they should be in site.yml.tmpl.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re cloning or forking Tracks from <a href="http://github.com/bsag/tracks/">GitHub</a>, you might be interested in some changes you can make to your .bashrc to make using git a bit more comfortable. Henrik over at The Pug Automatic posted <a href="http://henrik.nyh.se/2008/12/git-dirty-prompt">this tip</a> for putting both your current branch name on the command line, and also indicating whether you have any uncommitted changes in the branch. If your branch has uncommitted changes, it prints an asterisk after the branch name. This is incredibly helpful for seeing at a glance what state you are in, without having to issue the commands &#8216;git branch&#8217; or &#8216;git status&#8217;. If you flit about between branches a lot, having the branch name at the command prompt can save you from a great deal of trouble.</p>
<p>You can grab Henrik&#8217;s code <a href="http://gist.github.com/31631">here</a>, or use mine below. I just foraged around among the forks and the comments on <a href="http://www.simplisticcomplexity.com/2008/03/13/show-your-git-branch-name-in-your-prompt/">this related post</a> to get a version combining the best bits of them all, then I substituted in my existing command prompt. Enjoy!</p>

    <id>http://TracksApp.github.com/news/comments/tracks-gets-its-own-domain-name</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&#8230;and a new home! I have now completed the migration to the new Shared Accelerator at <a href="http://joyent.com/">Joyent.com</a>, and in the process, gave Tracks its own domain name: getontracks.org. You may find that the new server feels a bit more snappy than the old one, and it should be more stable and reliable. The migration process was fairly complex, and it&#8217;s possible that some links may be broken, so do please email me if you find anything amiss. I&#8217;ve redirected the old domain to the new one, so feed readers should pick up the redirection. If they do not, you might want to enter the new feed <span class="caps">URL</span> manually for the <a href="http://www.getontracks.org/tracks/rss_2.0/">RSS2 feed</a> or <a href="http://www.getontracks.org/tracks/atom/">Atom feed</a>.</p>
<p>I was hoping to replace our Trac bug tracker with a custom solution run with ExpressionEngine (which runs this site), but importing existing tickets proved too much for my pre-Christmas brain! Instead, I imported all the old tickets into an <a href="http://www.assembla.com/spaces/tracks-tickets/tickets">Assembla space</a>. Assembla offers a number of rather cool features, and will be easier for me to administer. You can find out how to use the site to submit tickets <a href="http://getontracks.org/development/">here</a>.</p>
