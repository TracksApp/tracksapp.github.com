Version: Tracks 1.6

I'm pleased to announce that Tracks 1.6 has been released.

What's new:

* The included Rails version is updated to 2.0.2
* You can now search the contents of todos, projects and notes (thanks, Jeffrey Gipson!)
* Improvements to the mobile view, including a few iPhone specific improvements for those of you lucky enough to have an iPhone
* A few bug fixes

An important caveat is that OpenID support is broken in 1.6. The fix is a bit complicated because of changes to the ruby-openid gem, so we wanted to get 1.6 out before fixing it. If you depend on OpenID support, we'd advise waiting until the next release.

There are no changes to the database, but quite a few changes to config/environment.rb.tmpl, so please copy the template file and merge your personalisations with it.

Many thanks to Luke, Reinier and Jeffrey for their hard work on this release!
