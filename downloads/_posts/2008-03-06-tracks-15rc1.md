Version: Tracks 1.5RC1

It's nearly here!

This is the first release candidate for the Tracks 1.5 release. If you are currently using Tracks 1.043, you'll find heaps of brilliant new features, bug fixes and improvements in this version. The manual is included in the /doc directory of the download and the subversion version, but you can dowload it separately <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/files/manual_1.5.pdf">here</a> if you like. There are also a few screenshots to whet your appetite on the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/wiki/Tracks1.5rc1/">wiki</a>.
