Version: 1.02a

There are quite a few improvements to this version, with more on the way. Note that Rails 0.10.0 is a *requirement* for this version, as is Ruby 1.8.2 or above. The full installation and upgrading instructions are in the zipped directory in doc/README.txt. Please read those instructions carefully, along with README_FIRST.txt
