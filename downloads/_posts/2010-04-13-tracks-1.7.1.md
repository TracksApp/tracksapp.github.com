<p>A message from Reinier Balt:</p>

<p>I'm pleased to announce that Tracks 1.7.1 has been released. This is a bug fix release. This will be the last release for 1.7. We are working towards the release of Tracks 2.0 which will include new functionality.</p>

<p>You can download this new stable version of Tracks <a href="http://github.com/bsag/tracks/zipball/1.7.1">directly from Github</a> and a manual can be found <a href="http://github.com/bsag/tracks_manual">also on Github</a> as well as on the <a href="http://getontracks.org/doc/index.html">Tracks</a> website.</p>

<p>What is new in 1.7.1:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can now add a new todo from the calendar view</li>
<li>User names can now contain dots (.)</li>
<li>Support for OneNote urls (hyperlinks to Microsoft OneNote elements)</li>
</ul>

<p>Under the hood:</p>

<ul>
<li>Several fixes for timezone support</li>
<li>Export to xml works again</li>
<li>Tracks works on current rubygems</li>
<li>Notes are styled better</li>
</ul>

<p>And lots of other fixes...</p>

<p>This release of 1.7 includes contributions made by several contributors (JPenny,Henrik Bohre, ecognito, Steven Aerts and Eric Allen of course; I hope I didn't forget anyone.) and of course all the people who helped reporting issues on Assembla. Thank you all for helping Tracks getting better every release.</p>
