Version: 0.9

This is compatible with Rails 0.8.x. Please note that it _won't work_ with Rails versions greater than 0.9.

The installation instructions are in a README in todo/docs. You also need to have Ruby 1.8.x, mySQL and Rails 0.8 installed. See the "Elsewhere" links to the left if you need help installing any of those applications.
