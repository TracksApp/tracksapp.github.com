Version: 1.041

See doc/CHANGELOG for the full details of what's new in this release, but the highlights are:

1. Tracks now has an API, written by Luke Melia, which allows you to create new actions in a particular context remotely, using scripts. See http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/downloads/comments/adding-next-actions-via-scripts-the-tracks-api/ for some example scripts and instructions. If anyone creates scripts for other platforms (Windows or Linux), or more fancy ones for Mac OS X, do share them!
2. The feeds page now lists iCal links alongside each RSS and TXT feed link. Copying your chosen link and pasting it in to the text box that appears in iCal when you choose Calendar > Subscribe.. Name your calendar as you wish, but make sure that you get it to refresh periodically and that the 'Remove Todo items' checkbox is UNCHECKED (obviously <img src="http://www.getontracks.org/images/smileys/wink.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="wink" style="border:0;" /> ). Then your Tracks next actions should appear as todo items in iCal, with proper due dates assigned, and notes in the notes field. The todos should update periodically in iCal as you add, delete or complete items in Tracks, but the subscription is read-only from iCal's end. However, it does allow you read access on the move if you sync iCal with your Palm or mobile phone.
3. Setting no_completed in the user preferences to zero now removes the completed items box completely from the home page and from the individual context and project pages, if you don't like completed items cluttering those pages up.
4. You can set a local time zone in environment.rb if your local time zone is different from the time zone setting on the server running Tracks.
5. 'Add users' link added to the navigation bar for the admin user, which is a convenient way to get to the signup page.
6. Luke fixed the edit actions method so that changing an action's context immediately moves it in an Ajaxy way to the new context.
7. Updated vendor directory to Rails 1.1
