Version: Tracks 1.042

This is a maintenance release only, with a security update applied to counter the [vulnerability in Rails](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/8/10/rails-1-1-6-backports-and-full-disclosure) reported by the Rails core team. There are no other changes from 1.041, so if you're running 1.041, upgrading is simple. Change the name of your old Tracks directory to (for example) tracks-1041-old. Unzip Tracks 1.042 to a new directory, then copy over config/database.yml, config/environment.rb, and the log directory from tracks-1041-old to the correct locations in your new Tracks directory. If you're using sqlite or sqlite3, you'll also need to copy over your sqlite database from the old db directory to the new one. Once you've got the new copy of Tracks working, you can delete the old directory.

This is a recommended upgrade for all users.
