Hi all,

Tracks 2.2 is being released today with a variety of new features and bugfixes! You can download the release "here":https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/archive/v2.2.zip. Upgrade instructions can be found in the manual.

New in this release:
* Added caching to various parts of Tracks to speed things up
* Better support for running Tracks with PostgreSQL
* Improvements to the mobile interface (Thanks to Tim Madden for his work on that!)
* Support for running Tracks with Ruby 1.9.x
* Tons of bugfixes and other improvements

This release also sees the addition of a new member to the Tracks team. Please welcome Dan Rice as a new committer! Dan has been instrumental in improving our support for PostgreSQL and making a ton of other small improvements to the Tracks codebase for this release.

Enjoy!
